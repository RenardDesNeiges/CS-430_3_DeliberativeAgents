Implementation of a planning deliberative agent with graph-search algorithms.

## Tasks from the problem definition :
* **NOT DONE** Choose an adequate reprensentation of **states**, **transitions** and **goals** (final states), such that BFS or ASTAR will be able to find an optimal solution for the pickup and delivery problem ==> see doc/problemDefinition.pdf
* **NOT DONE** Implement BFS and ASTAR, choose an algorithm and justify
* **NOT DONE** Implement a deliberative agent that can use the above algorithms
* **NOT DONE** Compare performance of ASTAR and BFS for various problem sizes
* **NOT DONE** Run the simulation with 1,2,3 deliberative agent and report on the diffrences and joint performances of the agents

## Todo : 

* Define states, transitions and goals representations
* Implement the agent
* Write a report
